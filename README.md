## What is

A tool to manage your deliveries and delivery men from your business

## About

With this API you can hire deliverymen and define recipients and origins to register new deliveries.

As a delivery man you can get the product and register the product to delivery and register the end of delivery with a picture of recipient signature
in addition to being able to inform problems with delivery for your cancellation.

A delivery man is only able to do 5 deliveries per day at 8:00 AM to 18:00 PM.
